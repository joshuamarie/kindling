Description: Provides a higher-level interface to the 'torch' package for defining,
    training, and tuning neural networks. This package supports feedforward 
    (multi-layer perceptron) and recurrent neural networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU), and also reduces 
    boilerplate code while enabling seamless integration with 'torch'. The methods to train 
    neural networks from this package also bridges to titanic ML frameworks in R namely
    'tidymodels' ecosystem, enabling the 'parsnip' model specifications, workflows, recipes, 
    and tuning tools.
