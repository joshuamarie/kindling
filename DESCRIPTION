Description: Provides a higher-level interface that bridges the 'torch' and 
    'tidymodels' ecosystems, allowing users to easily define, train, and tune 
    deep learning multiple types of model, such as feedforward neural networks, 
    convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). 
    The package supports hyperparameter tuning for network architecture 
    (number of hidden layers, units, and activation functions) and is designed 
    to integrate seamlessly into 'tidymodels' workflows for 
    model training and evaluation.
