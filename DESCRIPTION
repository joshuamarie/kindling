Description: Provides a higher-level interface designed to reduce boilerplate 'torch' code 
    and designed to integrate 'tidymodels' ecosystems, allowing users to easily define, 
    train, and tune deep learning multiple types of model, namely feedforward neural networks, 
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
