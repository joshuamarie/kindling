Description: Provides a higher-level interface to the 'torch' package for defining,
    training, and fine-tuning neural networks, including its depth, powered by code generation. 
    This package currently supports few to several architectures, namely feedforward (multi-layer perceptron) 
    and recurrent neural networks (Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), 
    while also reduces boilerplate 'torch' code while enabling seamless integration with 'torch'. The model methods 
    to train neural networks from this package also bridges to titanic ML frameworks in R, namely
    'tidymodels' ecosystem, which enables the 'parsnip' model specifications, workflows, recipes, 
    and tuning tools.
