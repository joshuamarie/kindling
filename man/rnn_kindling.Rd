\value{
A model specification object with class \code{rnn_kindling}.

\description{
\code{rnn_kindling()} defines a recurrent neural network model that can be used
for classification or regression on sequential data. It integrates with the
tidymodels ecosystem and uses the torch backend via kindling.
}
\details{
This function creates a model specification for a recurrent neural network
that can be used within tidymodels workflows. The model supports:
\itemize{
\item Multiple RNN types: basic RNN, LSTM, and GRU
\item Bidirectional processing
\item Dropout regularization
\item Hyperparameter tuning integration
\item Both regression and classification tasks
}
