\format{
\code{nn}: An environment of class \code{torch_nn} containing torch neural network modules

\code{nnf}: An environment of class \code{torch_nnf} containing torch functional neural network operations

An object of class \code{torch_nnf} of length 99.

\usage{
nn

nnf
}
\description{
\code{{kindling}} dynamically constructs two environments, \code{nn} and \code{nnf},
by extracting all exported functions from the \code{{torch}} namespace that
begin with \code{nn_} and \code{nnf_}, respectively.
}
\details{
These functions are then renamed by removing their \code{nn_} or \code{nnf_}
prefixes and optional trailing underscores, and stored as members of
the corresponding environment. This provides an interface similar in
spirit to PyTorch's \code{torch.nn} and \code{torch.nn.functional}, but programmatically
generated from \code{{torch}}'s own exports.
}
\section{Implementation}{

The environments \code{nn} and \code{nnf} are created at package build time.
Each environment contains callable modules and functional operators
directly referencing the corresponding \code{{torch}} objects.

\examples{
# Compose a simple feedforward model using nn
model = nn$sequential(
    nn$linear(10, 5),
    nn$relu(),
    nn$linear(5, 1)
)
model

# Use functional operations from nnf
\dontrun{
x = torch::torch_randn(5, 10)
y = nnf$relu(x)
