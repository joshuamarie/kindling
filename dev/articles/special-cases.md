# Special Cases: Linear and Logistic Regression

## What’s so special about {kindling}

This package is planned to make it compatible for any machine learning
task. Yes, you can do both linear regression and logistic regression
with extra steps: heavily customized optimizer and loss functions. The
[`train_nn()`](https://kindling.joshuamarie.com/dev/reference/gen-nn-train.md)
function (available on \>v0.3.x) supports this { `optimizer`
\leftrightarrow `optimizer_args` } and { `loss` }
