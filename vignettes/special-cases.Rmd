## What's so special about {kindling}

This package is planned to make it compatible for any machine learning task. Yes, you can do both linear regression and logistic regression with extra steps: heavily customized optimizer and loss functions. The `train_nn()` function (available on >v0.3.x) supports this { `optimizer` $\leftrightarrow$ `optimizer_args` } and { `loss` }
